### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. The DOM method can be useful as it can be used to change the content of the page. In this case, it was used so that the user could click to see more photos in the gallery.
2. "zIndex" is used when using DOM, but when using CSS it is "z-index". This helps the order of the stacked elements.
3. If you had a node that you wanted to duplicate and alter, you could instead clone it using "existingNode.cloneNode(true | false)".
